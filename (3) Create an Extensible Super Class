Q1: Using the code created in the previous exercise, create an extensible superclass definition. Set the properties and methods that subclasses will need.
A1:

class Automobile {
    public $make;
    protected $year;
    protected $color;
    private $model;

    public function __construct($make, $year, $color, $model) {
        $this->make = $make;
        $this->year = $year;
        $this->color = $color;
        $this->model = $model;
    }

    public function startEngine() {
        echo "Starting the {$this->year} {$this->make} {$this->model}'s engine.\n";
    }
}

class Car extends Automobile {
    public function accelerates() {
        echo "The car is accelerating.\n";
    }
}

class Van extends Automobile {
    public function breaks() {
        echo "The van is breaking.\n";
    }
}

Q2: Create one or more subclasses that extend the superclass with constants, properties, and methods specific to the subclass.
A2: Subclass to the current class Car

class ElectricCar extends Car {
    public $battery;

    public function __construct($make, $year, $color, $model, $battery) {
        parent::__construct($make, $year, $color, $model);
        $this->battery = $battery;
    }

    public function checkBattery() {
        echo "The electric car has a battery % of {$this->battery}%.\n";
    }

    public function charge() {
        echo "Charging the electric car.\n";
    }
}

Q3: Instatiate a couple of objects from the subclasses and execute the methods producing some output.
A3:  

// Car
$toyotaCamry = new Car("Toyota", 2023, "Blue", "Camry");
$toyotaCamry->startEngine();
$toyotaCamry->accelerates();

// Van
$fordTransit = new Van("Ford", 2023, "White", "Transit");
$fordTransit->startEngine();
$fordTransit->breaks();

// Electric Car
$teslaModel3 = new ElectricCar("Tesla", 2023, "Red", "Model 3", 75);
$teslaModel3->startEngine();
$teslaModel3->accelerates();
$teslaModel3->checkBattery();
$teslaModel3->charge();

Output:

Starting the 2023 Toyota Camry's engine.
The car is accelerating.

Starting the 2023 Ford Transit's engine.
The van is breaking.

Starting the 2023 Tesla Model 3's engine.
The car is accelerating.
The electric car has a battery % of 75%.
Charging the electric car.
